# pymdp_depression
Simulating Interpersonal Experience with Active Inference. 

MASTER_simulations
+ produces all transdiagnostic and clinical simulations in one go.
+ uses main_simulation_func as the suite to produce one time series simulation. 

compute_avg_earning, compute_avg_earning_long
+ earnings of the agents in a series.

compute_avg_series, compute_avg_series_long
+ supplementary analysis: averaged posterior beliefs over N simulations. 

library
+ contains all agents

gms
+ generative models

inference
+ active inference algorithm (in sync with pymdp toolbox, Heins et al)

envs
+ the trust game environment

vis
+ plots and visualizations
